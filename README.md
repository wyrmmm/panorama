## Panorama

This is a web application side project that I developed to practice using React hooks, Redux, Storybook, and React Testing Library. It also provided an opportunity for me to start learning Node.js.

You can click on the country, and the web application will show you the latest tweets, news, and Google trends for that country. And the map will also move to that country! Isn't that great?

Probably not.

But it let me learn a few things, so that is great after all :)
